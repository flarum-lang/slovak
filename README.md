# Flarum Slovak Language Pack

Slovak language pack for [Flarum](https://flarum.org).

### Beta.15 Progress:
So far, the core and its bundled extensions are translated. Validations aren't fully translated.
I plan to support all extensions available at [FreeFlarum](https://discuss.flarum.org/d/7585) in the future.

### Installation:
```
composer require flarum-lang/slovak
```

### Updating
```
composer update flarum-lang/slovak
php flarum cache:clear
```

I know that not many Slovakians will use this language pack, but I want to contribute with my bit to make Flarum open for more people.
